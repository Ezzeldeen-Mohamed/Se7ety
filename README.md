# üè• Se7ty - Smart Healthcare Application (Backend)

## üìå Overview
**Se7ty** is a smart healthcare mobile application backend designed to provide **simple home healthcare services** through local pharmacies.  
The platform helps patients (especially elderly and people with basic health needs) easily access reliable services such as:

- Blood pressure & sugar measurement  
- Injections  
- Steam sessions for children  
- Initial consultations to determine the case  

The system works like **Uber-style booking** where the user selects a service, chooses a nearby pharmacy with pricing, and confirms the request.
